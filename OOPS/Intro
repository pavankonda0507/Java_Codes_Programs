In object oriented programming it takes all things as object.
This OOPS concept is basically to solve the Real world problems using the Virtual world.

Object - Object has the Properties and behaviors.
Generally to create the object we have to create the class.

class - In programming class can act as the blue print
        We can say design

*The class file or the blue print is compiled to create the byte code and it is given to the JVM to create the Object.

Object creation -

            Ex:    demo d = new demo();
                   d.add();

    ~ Basically for the object creation we give the 'new' keyword
    ~ For the object creation we will tell the JVM to create the new object but the JVM asks the Design for it and here the design is
      nothing but the class(demo())
    ~ And this object is assigned to the variable d.
