Costructor does not have the return type, these are just like methods it has name
The constructor name same as the class name
There is no need of calling the constructor it is called automatically by creating the object 

Constructors are two types
    1.Default   
        -A constructor that has no parameters is known as default the constructor.
        -If there is no constructor in a class, compiler automatically creates a default constructor.

        Ex:
                class bike {              class bike {
                                ------>       bike() {}
                }                         }

        -The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.
    2.Parametarized
        -A constructor which has a specific number of parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
        -If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.
        -The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.


*Every constructor by default consist of super() method without mentioning.
 And if we want to call the parameterized constructor we have to mention super(parameters) by explicitly.
